# IDX-Partners---Credit-Risk-Prediction
This GitHub repository focuses on developing machine learning models for credit risk prediction. 
In this project, our goal is to create a model that can help identify and predict credit risks with high accuracy, recall, and precision.

The project includes the use of various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and others. 
We also implement data preprocessing techniques such as handling outliers, handling missing values, and data normalization to ensure good data quality before modeling.

Additionally, in this repo, we perform model validation using cross-validation methods to ensure the reliability and generalization of the developed models. 
We also conduct hyperparameter tuning to improve the model's performance and achieve optimal results.

The repo contains Jupyter notebooks that showcase code implementation, data visualization, and in-depth analysis of the results. 
We hope that this project provides a better understanding of credit risk prediction using machine learning. 
This repo can serve as a learning resource and reference for those interested in this domain. 
We also welcome collaboration and contributions from the community to further enhance and develop this project.

Thank you for visiting.
